# Welcome to the Fusion Data Platform

The **Fusion Data Platform (FDP)** is a cutting-edge **machine learning and data science platform** designed to support the design and safe operation of a **Fusion Pilot Plant (FPP)**. FDP enables researchers and data scientists to develop high-quality, reproducible AI/ML workflows using fusion data from both experiments and simulations.

FDP is being developed as a **federated resource**, allowing collective usage of distributed computational facilities and enabling advanced AI/ML modeling techniques to tackle critical fusion science challenges. The platform adheres to **FAIR principles** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable), ensuring that fusion data and models are easily discoverable and reusable by the scientific community.

## Core Technologies

FDP is built upon a **modern, federated infrastructure** integrating key tools and technologies for data management, processing, and AI/ML model development. The core technologies include:

### **Open Science Data Federation (OSDF)**
- Provides **distributed data access** across multiple fusion research facilities.
- Enables large-scale data storage and retrieval with **low-latency caching mechanisms**.
- Proven technology from **High Energy Physics (HEP)** and **LIGO**.

### **Common Metadata Framework (CMF)**
- Implements **integrated distributed version control** for **data, metadata, and code**.
- Ensures full **provenance tracking**, making workflows reproducible and auditable.
- Built by **Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE)** to enable **scalable scientific data management**.
